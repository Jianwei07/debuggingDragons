## Set up and how to run the app
1. Make sure python and vscode are installed.
2. Install the dependencies in ```environment.yml``` via one of these methods:
   - Clone the conda environment (probably better). Download conda/conda navigator, in conda navigator import ```environment.yml```, launch vscode under 'Flask' environment. Or just create the conda environment in CLI using ```conda env create -f environment.yml```, ```conda activate Flask```
   - Just pip install the missing dependencies. Important ones are flask and flask alchemy and anything you are missing when you run the app. ```pip install flask flask-sqlalchemy```.
3. Launch vscode -> open folder -> this repo
4. In your terminal in VSC, navigate to this directory containing app.py. Run ```python app.py```.
5. Open your browser, go to ```http://localhost:5000/```.
